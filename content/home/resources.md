We are continuously building various data analytics capabilities to our already comprehensive 5G test network at ITEE Faculty, University of Oulu. Currently, we are running an ERDF investment project called "Big Data for 5G", worth 1 Mâ‚¬, to reinforce 5G test network with the following capabilities:

* Central computing cluster - an in-house IaaS cloud environment for CPU and GPU analytics, as well as localized storage.
* Edge computing - dedicated server resources for several business verticals, enabling edge analytics to be included in application and service design.
* Pilot sensor networks - sensor data sources that act as a basis for research projects and piloting in data analytics. One focus area is the Tellus Arena, which hosts sensors for air quality measuring, as well as a Bluetooth-based asset tracking system.

The following image summarizes the focus areas of the project: Pilot sensor networks along with 5G test network wireless access technologies are used to generate rich data streams from real-world environments. These data streams can first be analyzed at the network edge level, after which the data streams can travel to cloud back-end for further analytics. End result is added value from data, packaged into a certain application or service logic, and provided back to the physical environment.
